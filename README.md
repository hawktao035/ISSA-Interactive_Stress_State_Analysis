# ISSA-Interactive_Stress_State_Analysis
INTRODUCTION: ISSA aims to enhance the teaching effectiveness of stress state analysis, including 2D Mohr's Circle demonstrations, stress state analysis, and more in the solid and geotechnical fields. A 3D version will be released in the future.
DESIGNER: The software was designed by Hongkai Tao (primary copyright holder), Qi Zhao, Jiayan Wang, Chengyang Zhu, and Jingran Li, with Copyright No.: 2024SR0930845.
SOURCE FILE: The main source file (ISSAAnalysis.mlapp) can be accessed via MATLAB. Two additional figures are available for download to maintain completeness, although downloading them is optional and does not affect the core functionality of the software.
DOWNLOAD: The software can be downloaded and used via Software 5.5 (online) OR Software 5.5 (offline). The online version has a smaller file size and requires an internet connection to download both the runtime and ISSA, whereas the offline version includes everything in a larger package and does not require an internet connection. Specifically, download ISSA simply through MyAppInstaller_web.exe in Software 5.5 (online) OR MyAppInstaller_mcr.exe in Software 5.5 (offline). Other files attached need NO attetion.
